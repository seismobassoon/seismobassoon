I was born in Hyogo, one Friday, November 26th, 1982 and I experienced the Kobe earthquake when I was 12 years old. 
However, instead of making me decide to become a seismologist, I just learned that the earthquake prediction is impossible
and that the media and the government had been emphasising the potential danger of only the "big one" in Tokyo region but not elsewhere, 
while it is natural to have catastrophic earthquakes whenever and wherever in Japan.

I started my studies at University of Tokyo in 2001 but most of the time I found myself in the corridor of students' house to work on my bassoon playing, under the sueprvision of Hitomi Sugawara, who has treated me like his son until his passing way on February 2022.

I defended [my thesis in 2010](https://ndlsearch.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000002-I000011108642) on a new methodology to invert seismic waveforms for elastic and anelastic structure, under the supervision of Robert J. Geller at University of Tokyo.

I then quitted Japan, attracted by olive oil, to work with Sébastien Chevrot in Toulouse to optimise the computation of high-frequency waveform Fréchet derivatives from 2010.

I was recruited as an associate professor at [l'Institut de physique du globe de Paris](https://www.ipgp.fr) in 2012, had been the pedagogic head of international master (GPX and IMSES) from 2012 to 2020, elected member of the scientific council of IPGP from 2016 to 2019, scientific council member of global network GEOSCOPE from 2016 to 2022, and responsable of the theme *Earth's and planetary interiors* from 2016 to 2020. 

I finally defended my [habilitation à diriger des recherches (HDR)](https://hal.science/tel-05081045) in 2022 and became a junior member of [l'Institut universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/2392-nobuaki-fuji.html) from 2022.

From 2025, I am the head of seismology laboratory in IPGP.
