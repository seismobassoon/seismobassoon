10/2012–04/2017, PhD, supervised by Satish Singh and me. 

My very first PhD student working on the viscoelastic waveform inversion. We even spent one week in Ariège one summer, which I could call as the precursor of CLEEDI workshops. Very curious about everything, he was the one, together with Matthias Meschede, to bring Github culture to IPGP. When I look back now and recall of him suggesting to work in Julia, of which I am now enthousiastic. Thomas is now working as a data science consultant in Paris.
